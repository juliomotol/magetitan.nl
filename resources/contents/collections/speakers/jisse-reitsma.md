#### The talk: Rapid code development in Magento

"Magento development is often seen as difficult. We can do better. Generating code with AI seems like the easy trick, but it's only part of a huge toolbox that helps us develop more efficiently: Testing, analysis tools, development helpers. This talk gives you the management summary and teases you to do more with Magento."
