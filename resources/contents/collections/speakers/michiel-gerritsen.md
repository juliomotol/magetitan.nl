#### The talk: Lessons learned from integrating PSPs into the Hyvä Checkout

The Hyvä checkout is new and awesome, and it uses Magewire. But it does a lot of things differently compared to the Luma checkout, which introduces a learning curve. Next to that, implementing Payment Service Providers (PSPs) is not always as straightforward as it may seem. In this talk I will go over the challenges that I faced while implementing them.
