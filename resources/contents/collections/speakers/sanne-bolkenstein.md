#### The talk: ⚡ Rebuilding a community - what we can learn from the success of Mage-OS NL

After a few years of very little to no activity in the Dutch Magento community, a new industry association was founded last year: Mage-OS NL. Being part of the original founders and currently still a board member of Mage-OS NL, Sanne knows about rebuilding a Magento community.

Everywhere around the world we see a revival of Magento, fuelled by Mage-OS and Hyvä, proving Magento is still a relevant player in ecommerce, providing performance, cost effectiveness, and a great developer experience. The revival of the Magento community is nowhere as strong as in the Netherlands though, with an official industry association to represent the community, lots of events and new initiatives, culminating in the resurrection of Meet Magento NL last year, which was completely sold out and a huge success.

What's the secret of the Dutch Magento community? Why are competing agencies working so closely together? How's Mage-OS NL trying to be open and inclusive? Sanne will address all these topics in her talk! "
